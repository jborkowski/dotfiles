# About
This repository contains configuration files I use on Mac and Linux systems
which have been inspired by the rest of the dotfiles community.

# Installation
First of all install [stow] then clone this repo with git's `--recursive` flag to obtain all the submodules.
Run [restow.sh][restow.sh] to symlink all of the dotfiles in this repo
to the home directory and install vim plugins.
