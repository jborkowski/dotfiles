# Claude Development Guidelines

## Code Style

- **Use comments sparingly** - Only comment complex code
- **No promotional footers** - Do not add `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`

## Git Workflow

- **Commit incrementally and atomically** - Only commit compiling code
- **Do not commit user's thoughts** - Don't commit Jonatan's thoughts/notes unless explicitly asked
- **Atomic commits** - Each commit should represent a single, complete change
